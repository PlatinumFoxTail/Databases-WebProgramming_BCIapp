- The user can search and add BCI literature e.g. Title, Author, Pre-defined keywords, Rating, Availability
- The user can search and add comments to BCI related discussions e.g. Discussion topic: "BCI job openings in Finland" -> User1: "Can not find BCI companies in Finland. Any suggestions of companies based in Finland adjacent to BCI field?" -> User2: "You can try reaching out to comapny x, y, and z" -> User1: "I reached out to them both, and actually company y is about to initiate something in the field, so I will add it into the BCI stakeholder list"

Status at Intermediate hand-in 24.9.23:

I. Literature page improvement needs:
- The accepted form of BCI literature search should be dipslayed in the search boxes in gray e.g. keywords as {keyword1, keyword2}
- Some type of message should be displayed if Add literature is succesful or unsucessful or already added
- Title size of BCI literature search as h2 and h1 as Literature search
- Consider if have time to fine tune search function that can only add parts of the search items e.g. Brain computer*, only one keyword
